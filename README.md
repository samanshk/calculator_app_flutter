# Minimalistic Calculator

So, let's say you're working on your math and suddenly you feel "woo I need a calculator, erm but the calculators out there are too complex", well here we are, giving you the most minimalistic open source calculator! So, what's the deal? You get a calculator, also if you know flutter you can add some more good stuff to it to improve your calculating experience! (Oh, by the way, this calculator is made with flutter, so that you can butter your development! XD)

## What does this do? 🤔

It does what it says, calculates... It can add, multiply, divide, substract, calculate percentages and what not? You can modify the code as you like to make it more better!

## How to try it? 🤩

You will need flutter SDK for that. Go to [Flutter's docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/) and check how to have flutter on your system. 
Then open up a terminal and clone this repository using  `https://github.com/samanshk/calculator_app_flutter.git`, change to the directory using `cd calculator_app_flutter`. If you have any mobile devices/ emulators connected already, run `flutter run`, and that's it, a super minimalistic calculator would appear on your screen!.
